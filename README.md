## Introduction

This project implements a network scanner using Python, Tkinter, and Scapy. It allows users to scan their local network for connected devices, retrieve their IP and MAC addresses, and perform port scans on specific devices and port ranges.

## Features

- Scan a range of IP addresses to discover devices on the network.
- Retrieve IP addresses, MAC addresses, and device names.
- Perform port scans on individual devices to identify open ports.
- Threads for optimized port scanning efficency.
- GUI-based interface for ease of use.
